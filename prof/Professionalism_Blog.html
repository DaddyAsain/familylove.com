            <h2>Professionalism: Learning From Friends And Foes</h2>
            <p>Posted on July 27, 2024</p>
            <p>In this blog, I'll guide you through the entire journey of reading a book—from the moment you first lay eyes on it to the satisfying conclusion when you’ve turned the last page. Just as you might approach a conversation with a woman, I’ll take you step by step through the process, showing you how to make reading a delightful and stress-relieving experience.</p>
            <p>Now that you’re ready, let’s dive into the experience.</p>
            <h3>PHASE 1</h3>
            <p>
                We'll begin with how to feel at ease when you first see the book, move on to what to do once you've opened it, and continue through every stage until you’ve finished. By the end, you'll not only have completed a book but also discovered how reading can become one of the most enjoyable parts of your day.
                
                In life, there are moments when simply encountering a woman can make us forget our worries and stress, leaving us feeling relieved and rejuvenated. This sense of relief is not merely a fleeting emotion but a profound shift in our perspective. Similarly, approaching a book should evoke a similar sense of relief rather than feeling like a burden.
                
                When faced with a book, it's essential to shift our mindset and view it not as a chore but as a source of comfort and joy. If you find yourself perceiving a book as a burden, try these steps to transform your reading experience:
                
                Step1: Reflect on someone or something you deeply love or appreciate. Let this positive association color your perspective.
                
                Step 2: Begin your reading journey by invoking the name or memory of this cherished person or thing. This simple act can make the reading experience more enjoyable and fulfilling.

                    <h3>PHASE 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that you’ve opened the book and are swarmed by a large number of words, don’t worry! Just like when you see a girl and decide to approach her, you might initially be overwhelmed by a flurry of thoughts. In that situation, you push aside the mental clutter and focus on your physical actions. Similarly, when faced with a sea of words, let go of any distractions and focus on the physical movement that is: the physical movement of your eyes.
                        
                        Move your eyes slowly, word by word, absorbing the content just as you would observe a person's behavior when you approach them. Pay attention to the nuances in the text, much like noticing whether she’s happy, sad, or preoccupied. As you read, engage with the words with a positive mindset, similar to making eye contact with a warm smile. This approach helps you connect more deeply with the text, allowing the story to unfold naturally.

            <h3>PHASE 3</h3>
            <p>
                Now that you’ve started reading the book, it’s similar to beginning a conversation with someone you’re interested in. Just as you get into the flow of chatting with her, immersing yourself in her world, you’ll find yourself drawn into the flow of words and the world created by the author.

                However, just like when your favorite girl talks about something you’re not particularly interested in, and you tend to ignore that topic while still falling into a love-filled stare, appreciating her beauty, similarly you’ll encounter challenging words or complex passages in the book. Instead of getting stuck on these difficult words, continue to focus on the overall narrative flow. Embrace the reading experience as you would engage in conversation, allowing yourself to move past the distractions and stay immersed in the story.
                
                As you continue reading, think of it like deepening a conversation with someone you truly connect with. Just as you build a stronger understanding and bond with a person the more you interact, you’ll start to uncover layers of meaning and depth in the book.
                
                However, just as conversations can have their interruptions or distractions, reading may present moments where your focus wavers or where you encounter unexpected turns in the story. Embrace these moments with patience, just as you would navigate distractions in a chat, and return to the flow of the narrative with renewed attention.
                
                Remember, reading is not just about reaching the final page but about enjoying the journey through each chapter, just like savoring time with someone special. Reflect on the insights and experiences you gain from the book as you would after a meaningful conversation, appreciating the impact it has had on you.

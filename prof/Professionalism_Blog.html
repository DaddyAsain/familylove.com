            <h2>Professionalism: Learning from Friends and Foes</h2>
            <p>Posted on August 17, 2024</p>
            <p>When I speak of "friends" in the context of this blog, I am referring to individuals who have had a profoundly positive impact on society—figures like Nelson Mandela, who fought for justice and equality in South Africa, or Abraham Lincoln, whose leadership and moral compass guided the United States through the Civil War. These individuals embody the highest standards of professionalism, demonstrating qualities like integrity, resilience, and a commitment to the greater good. Conversely, when I refer to "foes," I mean those who have left a negative mark on history—murderers, assassins, and dictators who have inflicted harm on society. These figures, despite their morally reprehensible actions, can also offer lessons in professionalism, albeit in ways we must approach with great caution and discernment.</p>
            <p>Professionalism, in its essence, is about maintaining a high standard of conduct in all aspects of one's work and life. It involves qualities like competence, reliability, ethical behavior, respect for others, accountability, effective communication, and a commitment to continuous improvement. These traits help individuals navigate their careers with integrity and effectiveness, ensuring that they contribute positively to their workplaces and communities.</p>

            <p>With that in mind, let’s explore the professional behavior exhibited by Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. I want to make it unequivocally clear that in discussing Godse’s conduct, I do not endorse or justify his heinous act of killing Gandhi. Murder, especially of a figure as pivotal and peaceful as Gandhi, is an act that cannot and should not be condoned. However, it is important to analyze the aspects of Godse’s behavior that align with certain professional traits, understanding that this analysis is solely focused on his conduct and not on the morality of his actions.</p>
            <p>As I reflect on Godse's behavior, it is crucial to recognize that a conversation between two people of stable mind can never be violent in nature. This quote underlines the tragedy of Godse's actions—Gandhi was a man of peace, a stable mind who believed in nonviolence. Violence was used against him by Godse, which was deeply wrong. In contrast, the violence against the British during the struggle for Indian independence was justified in many ways, as the British, through their oppressive colonial rule, demonstrated a lack of stability in their moral and ethical conduct.</p>
            <p>This blog is inspired by my readings of "Why I Killed Gandhi," a book that includes Nathuram Godse’s testimony in court. This testimony provides insights into his mindset and actions, which, while fundamentally flawed in morality, do exhibit certain traits of professionalism.</p>

            <p>Godse was a man with a clear and focused plan. He meticulously planned the assassination of Gandhi, ensuring that his actions were aligned with his objectives. He did not intend to harm anyone else; his sole target was Gandhi. This level of focus and determination, though directed towards a deplorable goal, is characteristic of a professional approach. After the assassination, when Godse was brought back to the scene for reenactment, he was fully aware that his actions would lead to capital punishment. This awareness and acceptance of the consequences of his actions also reflect a certain level of professionalism—he knew what he was doing and was prepared to face the repercussions.</p>
            <p>There is a significant incident mentioned in Godse’s testimony where he was visited in jail by Mahatma Gandhi’s son, Devdas Gandhi. Devdas, expecting to meet a savage, ruthless killer, was instead met by a calm, composed individual who greeted him with respect and engaged in a rational conversation. Godse explained to Devdas that his actions were politically motivated and not driven by personal animosity. He expressed regret for the pain he had caused Gandhi’s family and acknowledged the wrath that had befallen them due to his actions. This interaction, though deeply tragic, showcases a level of composure, rationality, and responsibility—qualities often associated with professionalism.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Godse’s presentation of his viewpoints in court was done with such clarity and conviction that it left a lasting impression on those present. The judge presiding over the case remarked on the intense atmosphere in the courtroom, where Godse articulated his beliefs with precision and control. His arguments, though fundamentally flawed in their moral reasoning, were delivered in a manner that commanded attention and respect for his oratory skills. Godse also expressed a belief that, in the future, historians might come to value his words and understand his perspective. This demonstrates his awareness of the broader implications of his actions and his desire to be understood, even if not accepted, by future generations.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, while Nathuram Godse’s actions are unforgivable and his motives deeply misguided, the manner in which he conducted himself does offer certain insights into the concept of professionalism. His focus, determination, composure, and ability to articulate his thoughts clearly are traits that can be seen in many successful professionals. However, it is crucial to remember that these traits, when applied towards immoral or unethical goals, do not justify the actions taken. Professionalism must always be grounded in a strong ethical foundation, one that values human life, dignity, and the well-being of society.</p>
            <p>This blog is not an endorsement of Godse’s actions but rather an exploration of the complex nature of professionalism and the importance of applying it within a moral and ethical framework. We can learn from both the positive and negative examples in history, understanding that professionalism is not just about how we conduct ourselves, but also about the values that guide our actions.</p>
